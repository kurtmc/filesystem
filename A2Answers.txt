1. I was going to assume that the univeristy computes use the ext4 filesystem because it is the default
file system for many Linux ditros, but I ran the df -T command on the machines you can ssh to make sure.
It turns out there are 4 filesystem types used (none of them are ext4). They are, ext3, tmpfs, afs and
cifs.

ext3 has a maximum filename length of 255 bytes
afs has a maximum filename length of 255 bytes (looking in linux/fs/afs/afs.h, there is a macro called
AFSNAMEMAX and it is defined as 256 but one of those bytes would have to be null)
cifs may be limited by the NTFS file name length which is 255 bytes
(I couldn't find any filename length limit information on tmpfs)
